# The Center for Human Dynamics in the Mobile Age

This repository contains technical documents, examples, and code source developed by HDMA center at SDSU.

## How we created this.

This directory uses the open source documentation site, [Docusauras](https://docusaurus.io/) that can be deployed to [ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co) with zero configuration.
